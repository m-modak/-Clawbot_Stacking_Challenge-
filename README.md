# -Clawbot_Stacking_Challenge-

#Build overview:
- We added an arm and claw to our Basebot, Hannah. We also added two more motors to our bot. One for the arm to go up and down, and the other for the claw to open and close.
  
#Port assignments:
- The motor for the arm is connected to the 3rd port of the brain, and the motor for the claw is connected to the 4th port. We also used a 200mm smart cable for the arm motor and a 600mm smart cable for the claw motor.
  
#What your code does:
- Basically, what our code does is that we make Hannah go forward, turn around and go towards the blocks. He then opens his claws and grasps the block to then turn around again, and drive towards the squared spot that he has to place down the first block. He then repeats this unti he can at least stack 2-3 blocks on top of each other without falling over. It's kinda like Jenga!
  
#Reflection on what worked / what was hard: 
- Hannah works really well with the controller, and the arms and claws work just fine. The things that we struggled on was in the making of the arm since we restarted it many times. We also had a hard time on the code becasue Hannah would rather only do half of what the code tells him, doesn't complete the length we programmed him to drive, or it just doesn't work at all which was really frustrating. We (M) went around asking people to help us with our code and we found a code that helped us a lot, so we got that solved! Yippee!!!
